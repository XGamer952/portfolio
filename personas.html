            Investigating everyday access through the Greg A elevator system.

            The Greg A elevator at Brown University requires a swipe of a Brown
            ID card to both call the elevator and to select a floor once inside.
            While the system is reliable, students frequently express
            frustration about the inconvenience—especially when their hands are
            full or their ID is buried in a pocket. In this case study, I
            observed users, conducted interviews, developed personas, and
            created a storyboard to capture the full range of elevator
            interactions.

          <p>
            I observed students entering the Greg A elevator and documented
            their interactions. Most showed signs of impatience, especially when
            juggling items or waiting on slow door closures. Many were familiar
            with the process, but found it cumbersome nonetheless. I also
            interviewed three users.

              <strong>Bio:</strong> Sam is a 22-year-old senior who’s lived in
              the dorms for years and is deeply familiar with Greg A’s layout.
              He often carries groceries or gear from class, and finds the
              double-swipe requirement tedious—especially when he’s holding
              things. He values speed and hates repetitive friction.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Interface Problems:</strong> Sam is frustrated by the
              required ID swipes both outside and inside the elevator. He often
              wishes the elevator just knew which floor he wanted without
              needing interaction.

              <strong>Bio:</strong> Chloe is a sophomore living in Greg A after
              a year in freshman dorms. At first, she was intimidated by the ID
              swipe system and didn’t want to hold up the line. Over time, she’s
              become comfortable with the process and now navigates it at her
              own pace, rarely in a rush.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Interface Problems:</strong> Chloe occasionally forgets
              her card or mixes up which panel to swipe. She wishes there were
              clearer indicators about what comes next in the process, but
              overall has adapted to the system with few complaints.

          <h2>Storyboard: Speedster Sam’s Journey</h2>
          <p class="section-description">
            Sam is returning to his dorm from the gym, juggling his bag, water
            bottle, and keys. He’s used to the elevator, but he’s in a hurry and
            doesn’t want any delays.

          />
          <p>
            The storyboard follows Sam from hallway approach to elevator entry,
            revealing minor friction at each stage—fumbling for his card,
            waiting for doors to close, re-swiping to select a floor, and
            tapping the button multiple times. While the elevator is familiar to
            him, the repetition and lack of streamlining make every second feel
            longer.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This case study helped me realize that even highly functional
            systems like the Greg A elevator can create unnecessary friction for
            users when interaction patterns aren't streamlined. A reliable
            elevator is great, but requiring multiple swipes to perform a simple
            task adds cognitive and physical load—especially when users are
            carrying bags, in a hurry, or unfamiliar with the building.
          </p>
          <p>
            By designing personas across a spectrum of user experience—from
            confident to cautious—I better understood how invisible barriers
            form even in everyday tasks. The changes I would advocate for
            include clearer instructional signage, visual/sound feedback after
            swipes, and a reconsideration of double-authentication. These
            changes aim to reduce mismatches between user expectations and
            system behavior, following Kat Holmes’ framing of inclusive design.
